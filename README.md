# FCJ Exam Platform 
<!-- description -->
This is a full-stack web application that provides a solution for online assessment - authoring test contents and delivering exams.

Key Features:

1. CRUD Operations: Administrators can manage the assessment content by performing CRUD operations on Questions, Tests, and Exams databases. This feature provides customization for the assessment materials.

3. Exam Delivery via Email: Once exams are ready for delivery, administrators can send exam links to the designated exam takers via email. This ensures a secure and personalized approach to exam distribution.

4. Automated Grading: The platform automatically grades the submitted answers, saving valuable time for educators and providing immediate feedback to the exam takers.

5. Customized Certificates: Upon successful completion of an exam, the FCJ Exam Platform generates customized certificates for the exam takers. These certificates can be easily downloaded, providing recognition for their achievements.

You can explore the functionalities of the FCJ Exam Platform by trying out the deployed application at the following link: **[FCJ Exam Platform Demo](https://d1swv02b0ramfa.cloudfront.net/)**

Demo Credentials:
- Username: testUser
- Password: testUser123

The entire application - frontend, backend, and all configuration - can be deployed in AWS cloud environment.

## Getting started
To get your local up and running, please follow this set up guide:

### Prerequisites
- Install [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/download), [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if they are not already on your machine.
- Verify that you are running at least Node.js version 14.x, npm version 6.14.x, Git version 2.14.x or greater by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window
- [Create AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start/email). If you don't already have an AWS account, you'll need to create one in order to follow the next steps.
  
### Installation 

#### Set up Amplify environement 
- Create an empty directory and change current directory to that
- Run `amplify init --app <github url>`
- Follow prompts to install Amplify CLI and configure it to connect to your AWS account
- Check `src/aws-exports.js` is created
- Configure SES verified identities via SES Console.
For dev environment which use SES sandbox, only verified identities can send or receive emails via SES.
- Update lambda function environment variable:
  - Run `amplify update function`.
  - Choose `sendExamEmail` function
  - Variable name: `SES_EMAIL`
  - Variable value: an email address where email should be sent from. This email address should be verified in SES Console.


#### Build local dev environment 
- Run `npm install`
- Run `amplify push`
- Start local dev server: `npm start`
- Local dev server should run on `http://localhost:3000`

## Known limitations
- The SES service is in a sandbox environment, which allows sending emails to verified identities only.
- A glitch on Sign in form where sometimes clicking "Sign up" button shows the Sign in tab and vice versa. 

## Future roadmap
- Question categories (for filtering and searching) were modeled in the database but the UI has not been implemented
- Create a text editor to enable rich content (styling, inserting image, hyperlink, etc) formatting for question prompt and choices
- Create Timer for Exam, schedule exam and activate link only on Exam date and time.
